# DevSecOps Blue-Green Deployment on AWS ECS using CodePipeline & CodeDeploy

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a production-grade DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline that implements Blue-Green deployment on Amazon ECS (EC2 launch type) using AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and Application Load Balancer (ALB).
The pipeline integrates security at every stage (DevSecOps) and enables zero-downtime deployments with automated traffic shifting and rollback capability.

## Key Objectives

Implement zero-downtime Blue-Green deployment

Automate build, test, security scan, and deployment

Integrate DevSecOps tools (SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP Dependency Check)

Use AWS managed CI/CD services

Achieve production-ready deployment strategy
